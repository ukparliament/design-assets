# Design system simulation

A stylesheet written by Robert and Michael to ape the Parliament design system.

Created before we had access to the design system assets for use on [election results](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/), [egg timer](https://api.parliament.uk/egg-timer) and [procedure browser](https://api.parliament.uk/procedure-browser).

Some styles defined in this stylesheet may be covered by the design system. Others may not, or may not yet. The intention is to strip out this stylesheet, removing anything covered by the design system and moving anything else found necessary to library-extras.
